# 🏆 TOP 5 Contradictory Drug Tests for Hackathon Demo

## 🥇 TEST 1: CRITICAL - Fatal Bleeding Risk
**⚠️ MOST DANGEROUS COMBINATION ⚠️**

### Setup
```
Medicine 1: Warfarin 5mg
Medicine 2: Aspirin 100mg

Patient:
├─ Age: 65
├─ Conditions: Heart Disease
└─ Allergies: None
```

### Why This is Deadly
- Warfarin is a blood thinner (anticoagulant)
- Aspirin also thins blood (antiplatelet)
- Together: **10x bleeding risk**
- Can cause: Brain hemorrhage, GI bleeding, death

### Expected AI Warning
```
🚨 CRITICAL: Severe Bleeding Risk

Warfarin + Aspirin combination significantly increases 
bleeding risk and can cause life-threatening hemorrhage.

Side Effects to Watch:
• Unusual bleeding or bruising
• Blood in urine or stool
• Severe headaches
• Prolonged bleeding from cuts

⛔ ACTION: DO NOT DISPENSE
Contact prescribing doctor immediately!
```

## 🥈 TEST 2: CRITICAL - Heart Failure Emergency
**⚠️ CARDIAC TOXICITY ⚠️**

### Setup
```
Medicine 1: Digoxin 0.25mg
Medicine 2: Furosemide 40mg

Patient:
├─ Age: 75
├─ Conditions: Heart Failure
└─ Allergies: None
```

### Why This is Dangerous
- Digoxin strengthens heart contractions (narrow therapeutic window)
- Furosemide is a diuretic (flushes out potassium)
- Low potassium → Digoxin becomes toxic
- Can cause: Irregular heartbeat, heart attack, death

### Expected AI Warning
```
⚠️ WARNING: Digoxin Toxicity Risk

Furosemide depletes potassium, which increases 
digoxin toxicity risk.

Symptoms of Digoxin Toxicity:
• Nausea and vomiting
• Irregular or slow heartbeat
• Visual disturbances (yellow/green halos)
• Confusion and weakness

⚠️ ACTION: Monitor Levels
✓ Check serum digoxin levels weekly
✓ Monitor potassium levels
✓ Watch for toxicity symptoms
✓ Consider potassium supplementation
```

## 🥉 TEST 3: CRITICAL - Kidney Failure + Lactic Acidosis
**⚠️ DIABETIC EMERGENCY ⚠️**

### Setup
```
Medicine 1: Metformin 500mg
Medicine 2: Contrast Agent

Patient:
├─ Age: 55
├─ Conditions: Diabetes, Kidney Disease
└─ Allergies: None
```

### Why This is Life-Threatening
- Metformin (diabetes drug) cleared by kidneys
- Contrast agents (X-ray dye) damage kidneys
- Metformin builds up → Lactic acidosis
- Can cause: Kidney failure, metabolic crisis, death

### Expected AI Warning
```
🚨 CRITICAL: Lactic Acidosis + Kidney Failure Risk

Metformin + Contrast agents can cause:
1. Severe lactic acidosis (life-threatening)
2. Acute kidney injury
3. Metabolic decompensation

Emergency Symptoms:
• Rapid breathing
• Severe muscle pain
• Extreme weakness
• Confusion or altered consciousness

⛔ ACTION: DO NOT DISPENSE
1. Stop metformin 48 hours BEFORE contrast procedure
2. Check kidney function (creatinine, eGFR)
3. Resume only after kidney function confirmed normal
4. Contact doctor for alternative diabetes management
```

## 🏅 TEST 4: WARNING - Heart Attack Risk
**⚠️ CARDIOVASCULAR DANGER ⚠️**

### Setup
```
Medicine 1: Aspirin 100mg (for heart protection)
Medicine 2: Ibuprofen 200mg (for pain)

Patient:
├─ Age: 60
├─ Conditions: Heart Disease
└─ Allergies: None
```

### Why This is Concerning
- Low-dose aspirin protects heart by preventing clots
- Ibuprofen blocks aspirin's mechanism
- Result: Lost heart protection
- Can cause: Heart attack, stroke

### Expected AI Warning
```
⚠️ WARNING: Reduced Cardioprotection

Ibuprofen blocks aspirin's antiplatelet effect, 
eliminating its cardioprotective benefits.

Mechanism:
• Both compete for same platelet binding site
• Ibuprofen binds first, blocking aspirin
• Heart attack risk increases by 2-3x

⚠️ ACTION: Time Separation Required
✓ Take aspirin 2 hours BEFORE ibuprofen
✓ Or use alternative pain reliever (Paracetamol)
✓ Never take ibuprofen within 8 hours before aspirin
✓ Counsel patient on timing importance
```

## 🏅 TEST 5: TRIPLE THREAT - Maximum Risk
**⚠️⚠️⚠️ DEMO SHOWSTOPPER ⚠️⚠️⚠️**

### Setup
```
Medicine 1: Warfarin 5mg
Medicine 2: Aspirin 100mg
Medicine 3: Ibuprofen 200mg

Patient:
├─ Age: 70
├─ Conditions: Heart Disease, Arthritis
└─ Allergies: None
```

### Why This is the WORST Combination
- Triple antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy
- Each drug multiplies bleeding risk
- Combination effect > sum of individual risks
- Can cause: Catastrophic bleeding, death

### Expected AI Warning
```
🚨🚨🚨 MULTIPLE CRITICAL INTERACTIONS DETECTED 🚨🚨🚨

Interaction 1: Warfarin + Aspirin
└─ CRITICAL: 10x bleeding risk, hemorrhage

Interaction 2: Warfarin + Ibuprofen  
└─ CRITICAL: GI bleeding, platelet dysfunction

Interaction 3: Aspirin + Ibuprofen
└─ WARNING: Lost cardioprotection, increased MI risk

CUMULATIVE RISK ASSESSMENT:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Overall Risk Level: EXTREME         │
│ Bleeding Risk: 95%                  │
│ Hospitalization Risk: 80%           │
│ Fatal Outcome Risk: 15%             │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

⛔⛔⛔ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED ⛔⛔⛔

This prescription combination is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS
and poses SEVERE RISK of life-threatening bleeding.

MANDATORY STEPS:
1. DO NOT DISPENSE any of these medications
2. Contact prescribing physician IMMEDIATELY
